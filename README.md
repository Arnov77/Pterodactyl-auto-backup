# Pterodactyl auto backup

This script automates the process of creating backups on a Pterodactyl server, downloading them, and uploading them to Google Drive. It also supports Discord notifications to track the status of backup operations.

## Features

- **Backup Creation**: Automatically creates backups on a Pterodactyl server using its API.
- **Backup Download**: Downloads the created backup from the server once the creation process is completed.
- **Upload to Google Drive**: Uploads the downloaded backup file to Google Drive using the Google Drive API.
- **Discord Notifications**: Sends notifications to Discord for each stage of the backup operation (creation, download, upload).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x installed.
- Required Python packages: `google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-api-python-client`, `requests`.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local directory:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Arnov77/Pterodactyl-auto-backup.git
   cd Pterodactyl-auto-backup
   ```

2. Install all required dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

1. Create a `config.json` file with the following structure and fill in the information according to your environment:

   ```json
   {
       "discord_webhook_url": "https://YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL",
       "pterodactyl_api_key": "YOUR_PTERODACTYL_API_KEY",
       "pterodactyl_url": "https://YOUR_PTERODACTYL_URL",
       "server_id": "YOUR_SERVER_ID",
       "google_credentials_file": "./credentials.json",
       "drive_folder_id": "YOUR_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID"
   }
   ```

   - `discord_webhook_url`: Discord webhook URL for sending notifications.
   - `pterodactyl_api_key`: API key to access the Pterodactyl API.
   - `pterodactyl_url`: URL of your Pterodactyl panel.
   - `server_id`: ID of the server where backups will be managed.
   - `google_credentials_file`: Path to your Google Drive credentials JSON file.
   - `drive_folder_id`: ID of the Google Drive folder where backups will be uploaded.

2. Save and edit `config.json` with the correct information before running the script.

## Usage

Run the script using Python:

```
python3 backup.py
```

The script will perform the following actions:

- Creates a new backup on the specified Pterodactyl server.
- Downloads the backup once it's completed.
- Uploads the backup to Google Drive.
- Deletes the local backup file after a successful upload.

## Setting Up a Cronjob

To run the script automatically at specified intervals, you can set up a cronjob. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. Open the crontab editor:

   ```
   crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following line to schedule the script. For example, to run the script every day at 2 AM:

   ```
   0 2 * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/your/backup.py >> /path/to/your/backup.log 2>&1
   ```

   Make sure to replace `/usr/bin/python3` with the path to your Python interpreter, and `/path/to/your/backup.py` with the actual path to your script.

3. Save and exit the editor. The script will now run automatically at the specified time.

## Discord Notifications

The script provides Discord notifications for each step of the operation. Ensure your Discord webhook is properly configured to receive notifications.
